# Automating Web Application Deployment usinggit  AWS Native Tools

## Project Overview

This project focuses on automating the deployment and management of a web application's infrastructure and codebase. The goal is to enhance delivery speed, reliability, and consistency across environments. The application comprises two main components:

1. **Frontend**: A static web interface.  
2. **Backend**: A server-side API.  

The project uses AWS services to manage the infrastructure, which includes components such as EC2, S3, RDS PostgreSQL, and VPC (with subnets, IGWs, route tables, NAT, and NACLs).

## Objectives

1. **Automate Infrastructure Deployment**  
   - Use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to provision and manage cloud resources.  

2. **Automate Application Deployment**  
   - Implement continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines to automatically build, test, and deploy frontend and backend components whenever changes are made.  

3. **Ensure Environment Consistency**  
   - Standardize configuration templates and deployment processes across all environments.

## AWS Components and Services

### 1. **AWS CodePipeline**  
   - **Purpose**: Automates CI/CD pipelines for infrastructure and application code.  
   - **Usage**: Pulls code from repositories, triggers builds, runs tests, and deploys to various environments.  

### 2. **AWS GitHub Connect**  
   - **Purpose**: Acts as the source control service for managing repositories.  
   - **Usage**: Hosts Git-based repositories for both CloudFormation templates and application code (frontend/backend).  

### 3. **AWS CodeBuild**  
   - **Purpose**: Compiles source code, runs tests, and produces deployment artifacts.  
   - **Usage**: Builds application artifacts, runs unit tests, and prepares deployment packages.  

### 4. **AWS CloudFormation**  
   - **Purpose**: Provides an IaC service to create and manage AWS resources using declarative templates.  
   - **Usage**: Deploys and manages the infrastructure required for both frontend and backend components based on CloudFormation templates.
